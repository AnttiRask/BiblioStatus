# 📚 BiblioStatus

**BiblioStatus** is a web app that shows the real-time opening status of Finnish public libraries on a map.

## 🔍 Features

- 🌍 Interactive map with open/self-service/closed statuses color-coded
- 📍 **Find Nearest Open Library** - Uses GPS to find 3-5 closest open libraries with distances
- 🔍 **Library Text Search** - Search libraries by name, auto-switches to their city and zooms to location
- 🏷️ **Service Filtering** - Filter map by library services (247 unique services across 575 libraries)
- 💎 **Service Badges** - Services displayed as visual badges for better readability
- 📊 **Service Statistics Dashboard** - Explore service distribution with city filtering and interactive charts
- 🗺️ **Get Directions** - One-click Google Maps navigation to any library
- 📱 Mobile-optimized layout with responsive sidebar and touch controls
- 📞 **Contact Information** - Phone and email links for each library
- 📅 **Complete Daily Schedule** - View all opening periods (e.g., "10:00-14:00 Open, 14:00-20:00 Self-service")
- 🌗 Dark mode toggle
- 🏢 City/municipality filter
- 🔗 Clickable popups with library information and links
- 📦 Data updated daily via GitHub Actions and stored in Turso (cloud SQLite) with historical preservation
- 📚 **Normalized Database** - Library services stored in proper relational structure (11,722 service records)
- ✅ Automated URL monitoring with email alerts for broken links

## 🔄 Data Pipeline

**Daily Schedule Updates** (2:00 AM UTC):

1. GitHub Actions runs `fetch_library_data.R` in "schedules" mode
2. Fetches today's opening hours from [Kirkanta API (v4)](https://api.kirjastot.fi/)
3. Writes to Turso (cloud SQLite) - preserves historical data
4. Updates `libraries.sqlite` as backup/fallback

**Weekly Library Metadata** (Sunday 2:00 AM UTC):

1. Runs `fetch_library_data.R` in "both" mode
2. Fetches library metadata (names, coordinates, URLs, contact info, services)
3. Applies 50+ manual URL corrections and 8 coordinate fixes
4. Extracts and normalizes library services to `library_services` table (11,722 records)
5. Replaces library data in Turso (no historical versioning needed)

**App Data Access**:

- Primary: Reads from Turso database via HTTP API
- Fallback: Reads from `libraries.sqlite` if Turso unavailable
- Filters to today's schedules for real-time status display

## ✅ Data Quality & URL Monitoring

All library website URLs are automatically monitored daily:

- **Daily checks** run at 3:00 AM UTC (after data fetch)
- Validates all 720 library URLs for availability
- Email alerts sent if broken URLs are detected
- **Current status**: 95% working (683/720 libraries)
- Broken URLs are investigated and corrected within 24-48 hours

The monitoring workflow ensures users always have access to working library website links.
